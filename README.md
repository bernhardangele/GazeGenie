# GazeGenie

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/bernhardangele/GazeGenie)

A versatile tool for parsing, cleaning, aligning, and analyzing fixations from eye-tracking reading experiments.

## 🚀 Quick Start: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

The easiest way to run this application is through GitHub Codespaces. This method requires **no local installation** and runs entirely in your browser.

1.  Click the **"Open in GitHub Codespaces"** badge above.
2.  Wait for the environment to build.
3.  Once the terminal loads, the app will start automatically.
4.  Look for a notification in the bottom-right corner saying **"Your application is running on port 8501"** and click **Open in Browser**.

> **Note on Files:** Any files generated by the app will appear in the `results/` folder in the VS Code file explorer (left sidebar). Right-click files to download them to your machine.

## Run via Docker

If you have Docker Desktop installed, you can run the app locally without configuring Python environments.

**1. Create a results folder:**

```bash
    mkdir results
```

**2. Run the container:**

    docker run --name gazegenie_app -p 8501:8501 -v $(pwd)/results:/app/results bangele1/gazegenie:latest

*Note: If you are on Windows Command Prompt, replace `$(pwd)` with `%cd%`.*

**3. Access the App:**
In your browser, navigate to: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

**4. Restarting the container later:**
If you stop the container, you can restart it without creating a new one:

    docker start -a gazegenie_app

    # Create the environment
    conda create -n eye python=3.11 -y

    # Activate the environment
    conda activate eye

    # Install system dependencies
    conda install conda-forge::cairo

    # Install Python requirements
